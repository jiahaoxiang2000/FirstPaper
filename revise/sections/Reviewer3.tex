\begin{quote}
	 Reviewer \# 3 - This work implemented the CRAFT block cipher with two architectures proposed, the Serial architecture and the Unrolled architecture. Then, the efficiency of the implementations is tested on three FPGA platforms. The implementations proposed in this paper are interesting for the practical applications of CRAFT in IoT.

\subsection{Reviewer Comment}
C) Papers related to crypto need to consider this: With the advent of post-quantum cryptography, it is better to add some relevant papers including the followings to make sure you cover that topic too. When PQC replaces ECC/RSA every security application from smart phones to block chains will be affected. So mention about PQC and its threats adding these 4 papers:

**High-performance fault diagnosis schemes for efficient hash algorithm blake, 2019 IEEE 10th Latin American Symposium on Circuits \& Systems (LASCAS).

** CRC-oriented error detection architectures of post-quantum cryptography niederreiter key generator on FPGA, 2022 IEEE Nordic Circuits and Systems Conference (NorCAS), 2022.

**Error Detection Schemes Assessed in FPGA for Multipliers in Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms in post-quantum cryptography, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 2022.

**Hardware Constructions for Error Detection in WG-29 Stream Cipher Benchmarked on FPGA, IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 2023, to appear.



\subsection{Authors Response}

As a result, we've addressed the significant topic of post-quantum cryptography in the Introduction section of our revised manuscript. To support this new content, we've also included pertinent references. The detailed revisions are as follows:

Differential fault analysis, which is a type of side channel attack, was first introduced by [16]. This concept was later elaborated in more detail by [17]. In response to these fault attacks, several countermeasures have been suggested. For example, [18] introduced a scheme for error detection. In the realm of Post-Quantum Cryptography, [19] proposed specific error detection methods.

\subsection{Reviewer Comment}
E) You could add a subsection for Discussions

\subsection{Authors Response}

In response, we have added a Discussions section to improve the quality of our manuscript. The detailed revisions are as follows:

\color{blue}

This section discusses the performance of three different architectures of CRAFT: the serial architecture, the unrolled architecture, and the iterative architecture. These architectures are compared and analyzed to determine which one is best suited for different environments.

The serial architecture of CRAFT is designed to minimize area consumption. It has the lowest area consumption among the three architectures, which results in it having the lowest dynamic power. Additionally, it boasts the highest frequency among the three architectures. However, it has a high latency, leading to the lowest maximum throughput among the three architectures. The serial architecture is suitable for resource-limited environments where high throughput is not a requirement.

The unrolled architecture of CRAFT aims to maximize throughput. It boasts the lowest latency among the three architectures, which contributes to its highest maximum throughput, despite having the lowest maximum frequency. This architecture is also energy-efficient, offering the lowest energy per bit among the three architectures. However, it does have the highest area consumption. The unrolled architecture is best suited for environments where high throughput and low energy are priorities, and low area is not a requirement.

The iterative architecture of CRAFT is designed to strike a balance between area consumption and throughput. While it doesn't have the lowest area consumption, the highest frequency, the lowest latency, the highest maximum throughput, or the lowest energy per bit among the three architectures, it does have the highest throughput per slice. The iterative architecture is suitable for environments where moderate throughput is required at the lowest possible area cost.

Lara-Nino et al. [20] introduced a 16-bit datapath architecture for the PRESENT cipher, which resulted in reduced area and power consumption. Similarly, Pandey et al. [21] suggested an optimized key schedule for the same cipher, leading to a smaller area. Shahbazi et al. [22] put forth an 8-bit serial architecture for AES, which also reduces area and power consumption. Li et al. [23] presented unrolled architectures and a low-cost architecture for PRINCE, optimizing both throughput and area separately.

\subsection{Reviewer Comment}
- With the advent of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), it is better to add some relevant works to make sure you cover that topic too. This is the hottest topic in cryptography now. With PQC, add a paper on each of these six topics separately: (a) Curve448 and Ed448 on Cortex-M4, (b) SIKE on Cortex-M4, (c) SIKE Round 3 on ARM Cortex-M4, (d) Kyber on 64-Bit ARM Cortex-A, (e) Cryptographic accelerators on Ed25519, (f) Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange on 64-bit ARM.

\subsection{Reviewer Comment}
- NIST lightweight standardization was finalized in Feb. 2023. Also mention fault attacks as side-channel attacks, these topics to explore and add a reference on each of these separately: (a) Error Detection in Lightweight Welch-Gong (WG)-Oriented Streamcipher WAGE, (b) error detection reliable architectures of Camellia block cipher, (c) fault diagnosis of low-energy Midori cipher, (d) block cipher QARMA with error detection mechanisms.

In response to these fault attacks, several countermeasures have been suggested. For example, [18] introduced a scheme for error detection. In the realm of Post-Quantum Cryptography, [19] proposed specific error detection methods. It's important to note that these methods do increase the hardware consumption of the cipher system. The CRAFT cipher was designed with resistance to fault attacks in mind. However, it currently lacks efficient implementations. To make it suitable for use in more constrained environments, development of more efficient implementations is necessary.

\subsection{Response}
% TODO add specific table, need add the table in the response
Thank you for your suggestion. In response, we have added a new table in the Results section of our revised manuscript.

		Reviewer \# 1.3 - Papers related to crypto need to consider this: With the advent of post-quantum cryptography, it is better to add some relevant papers including the followings to make sure you cover that topic too. When PQC replaces ECC/RSA every security application from smart phones to block chains will be affected.

\subsection{Response}

We value your feedback. Accordingly, we've added a discussion about post-quantum cryptography in the Introduction section of our updated manuscript. To support this new content, we've also included pertinent references. We believe these modifications adequately address your concerns. The detailed revisions are as follows:

		Reviewer \# 1.8 - With the advent of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), it is better to add some relevant works to make sure you cover that topic too. This is the hottest topic in cryptography now. With PQC, add a paper on each of these six topics separately: (a) Curve448 and Ed448 on Cortex-M4, (b) SIKE on Cortex-M4, (c) SIKE Round 3 on ARM Cortex-M4, (d) Kyber on 64-Bit ARM Cortex-A, (e) Cryptographic accelerators on Ed25519, (f) Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange on 64-bit ARM.

\subsection{Response}
% TODO add similar work on the introduction

We appreciate your expert suggestion. However, our paper's primary focus is on hardware implementation, which is why we did not include the suggested papers on software implementation. In response to your feedback, we have expanded the Introduction section of our revised manuscript. This expansion includes a discussion on post-quantum cryptography, backed by relevant references. We trust that these modifications adequately address your concerns. The detailed revisions are as follows:

		Reviewer \# 1.9 - NIST lightweight standardization was finalized in Feb. 2023. Also mention fault attacks as side-channel attacks, these topics to explore and add a reference on each of these separately: (a) Error Detection in Lightweight Welch-Gong (WG)-Oriented Streamcipher WAGE, (b) error detection reliable architectures of Camellia block cipher, (c) fault diagnosis of low-energy Midori cipher, (d) block cipher QARMA with error detection mechanisms.

\subsection{Response}

% TODO use the SCA content of Introduction
We appreciate your expert suggestion. In response, we have broadened our discussion in the Introduction section to include fault attacks as a type of side-channel attack. We've also added relevant references to support this new content. We believe these modifications adequately address your concerns. The detailed revisions are as follows:
